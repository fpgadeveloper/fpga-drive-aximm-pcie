AI Engine: GMIO Matrix Multiplication Example
===============================================================================
The AI Engine matrix multiplication example demonstrates how to use AI Engine
for scalar computation, and use GMIO for data movement. In this example, to run
the matrix multiplication on the AI Engine, we use the standard matrix
multiplication algorithm. The user can change the matrix size and the number of
cores utilized at compile-time. The expected matrix size must be a multiple of
50 (number of cores used) with the minimum and maximum value as 100x100 and
1200x1200 respectively.
Please note that this example is intended to be a proof of concept only. There
can be other ways of implementation, which can leverage more of the AIE resource
and hence can result in better performance figures.
